# JavaScript Events

This repo contains three HTML pages. Each one has its own, separate JavaScript file. Each one demonstrates how JavaScript detects an event (a click, in all three cases) and manipulates the DOM.

* [index.html](https://macloo.github.io/javascript-new-events/index.html) &mdash; Click a DIV, and one paragraph is hidden, while another paragraph changes its background color. After you click the DIV once, you can't do anything else. This is the simplest example.

* [example2.html](https://macloo.github.io/javascript-new-events/example2.html) &mdash; This looks the same as the previous page, but now you click the DIV and the two paragraphs are hidden. A new DIV is revealed, and clicking it will bring back the two hidden paragraphs.

* [example3.html](https://macloo.github.io/javascript-new-events/example3.html) &mdash; CSS animation and JavaScript are used together to make several paragraphs fade out when clicked. It uses the JavaScript `.forEach()` method to affect all the P elements on the page.
